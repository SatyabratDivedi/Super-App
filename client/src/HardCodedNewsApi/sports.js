        "description": "Hardik Pandya Divorce: A lot seems to be happening in the personal and professional life of Hardik Pandya. The star India all-rounder returned to Mumbai Indians (MI), a franchise he debuted with in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2024. He was also appointed as the captain, replacing a highly successful Rohit Sharma. However, in his first year as captain of MI, Hardik failed to recreate the magic he had done with Gujarat Titans (GT) as MI finished 10th on the IPL 2024 points table.In his personal life too, Hardik may not have commented anything on the divorce rumours but him and his wife Natasa Stankovic have not made a public appearance together in recent times with Natasa even dropping the surname 'Pandya' from her Instagram account, hinting at a possible strain in their relationship. Post the IPL and the stress around his personal relationship, Hardik went for a vacation at an undisclosed overseas location.READ HERE | Is Hardik Pandya Vacationing Alone Amid Divorce Rumours With Natasa Stankovic?However, Hardik has now joined the rest of his Team India teammates in New York ahead of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024. He shared a few pictures of himself training alongside his India teammates. He captioned the pic: 'On national duty 🇮🇳' perhaps suggesting that the country comes first irrespective of whatever he may be going through personally.Take a look at Hardik's Latest Social Media Post Here:On national duty 🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/pDji7UkUSm— hardik pandya (@hardikpandya7) May 29, 2024Natasa Stankovic Posts Another Cryptic PostAmid all this, Natasa Stankovic has shared another cryptic post. Sharing a picture of the Bandra-Worli sea link in Mumbai on her Instagram story, she wrote: \"Praise God\". She accompanied the text with white heart and lovestruck emojis.ALSO READ | Hardik Pandya 'Divorce': Star Cricketer To Lose 70% Of Property To Natasa Stankovic?
